<h4><em>A Filipino Staple</em></h4>
<p class="center">Adobo is a popular Filipino meal that is typically made 
    with chicken or pork. White vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, 
    peppercorns, and bay leaves are pantry staples that are 
    used to make a marinade for this dish. The meat is 
    marinated in this combination for an entire night before 
    being simmered on the stovetop in the same marinade. The 
    meat is typically fried in oil before serving after being 
    cooked to perfection in the sauce, which is a distinguishing feature of the cooking technique. The adobo cooking method is believed to have started during the days before refrigerators, when people tried to preserve meat by cooking it in vinegar and salt (or soy sauce in modern renditions). 
    This traditional Filipino dish has countless variations.
